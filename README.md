# AR! Animal Roadtrip

![](https://github.com/aidawhale/tfmarcore/blob/master/GitHubImages/logo_name.png)

In this project, a mobile application has been developed. 
This app can be used to motivate paediatric patients and thus enhance the physical activity performed by them using Augmented Reality technologies.
This application does not require any previous configuration by the user, since it uses ARCore's automatic surface detection technology.

In addition, this application is complemented by a system that allows the collection and display of patient usage data.
These data will be of great interest to doctors, who will have a dynamic and indirect way of collecting data on the mobility and mood of their patients.
The web tool through which each patient's data can be consulted and modified is simple and intuitive, since the data is shown in a visual way through graphics, so that it is comfortable and easy to understand.
